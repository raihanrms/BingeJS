/* 
ðŸŒŸ APP: Fighting Game

Create an updateGame() function that will update the DOM with the state of the game ðŸ‘‡
========================================

- updateGame()

These are the 2 classes you must create and their methods ðŸ‘‡
========================================

class Player {
  - strike()
  - heal()
}

class Game {
  - play()
  - checkIsOver()
  - declareWinner()
  - reset()
}

These functions are hard coded in the HTML. So, you can't change their names.

These are all the DIV ID's you're gonna need access to ðŸ‘‡
========================================================
#1 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'play' = Button to run simulation
#2 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'result' = Div that holds the winner of the match
#3 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'p1Health' = Div that holds player 1's health
#4 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'p2Health' = Div that holds player 2's health

  // Update the DOM with the latest health of players

// ** Create the Player class which can create a player with all it's attributes and methods **

// qazi.name ðŸ‘‰ 'Qazi'
// qazi.health ðŸ‘‰ 100
// qazi.attackDmg ðŸ‘‰ 7

  strike () {

  }
  // ** Heal the player for random number from  1 to 5 **

}

// ** Create the Game class with all it's attributes and methods to run a match **

  }

  // ** If the game is over and a player has 0 health declare the winner! **
  declareWinner(isOver,p1, p2) {

  // ** Reset the players health back to it's original state and isOver to FALSE **
  reset(p1,p2) {
    
  }
  
  // ** Simulates the whole match untill one player runs out of health **
  play(p1, p2) {
    
    // Make sure the players take turns untill isOver is TRUE
    
    
    // Once isOver is TRUE run the declareWinner() method 
    

  }

}

// ** Create 2 players using the player class **
let player1 = new Player('Raihan', 100, 15)
let player2 = new Player('Faihan', 100, 15)

// ** Save original Player Data **
let p1 = player1
let p2 = player2

// ** Create the game object from the Game class **
let game = new Game();
updateGame(p1,p2,game.isOver)

// ** Save original Game Data **
let gameState = game.isOver


// ** Add a click listener to the simulate button that runs the play() method on click and pass in the players **


// ** BONUS **
// Add functionality where players can press a button to attack OR heal

// ** Player 1 Controls **


// ** Player 2 Controls **
