/* 
ðŸŒŸ APP: Fighting Game

Create an updateGame() function that will update the DOM with the state of the game ðŸ‘‡
========================================

- updateGame()

These are the 2 classes you must create and their methods ðŸ‘‡
========================================

class Player {
  - strike()
  - heal()
}

class Game {
  - play()
  - checkIsOver()
  - declareWinner()
  - reset()
}

These functions are hard coded in the HTML. So, you can't change their names.

These are all the DIV ID's you're gonna need access to ðŸ‘‡
========================================================
#1 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'play' = Button to run simulation
#2 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'result' = Div that holds the winner of the match
#3 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'p1Health' = Div that holds player 1's health
#4 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'p2Health' = Div that holds player 2's health

// ** Add a click listener to the simulate button that runs the play() method on click and pass in the players **


// ** BONUS **
// Add functionality where players can press a button to attack OR heal

// ** Player 1 Controls **
console.log(p1.strike(player1, player2, p1.attackDmg))


// ** Player 2 Controls **
console.log(p2.strike(player2, player1, p2.attackDmg))
